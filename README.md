# Metaheuristics
In this repository you will find some examples of metaheuristics and some databases with you can work with and test them. These are Eclipse projects, but you can open them with any code editor (Gedit or Sublime Text), and compile the solution using the Makefile included in the folders. If you want to process all the instance attached with the projects, you can use de process_all_instances.sh file, and modify it in order to get only the data you need.

Feel free to use my code as a reference, and if you use it, it would be nice if you name me or this repository, thx :)
